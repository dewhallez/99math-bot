It can only do substraction, addition, mulipilcations and division.

Somewhy it can only play on user created games, probably because i used xpath to find buttons.
Will maybe change it to something else in the future.

For it to play multiple rounds and not giving up randomly i had to use try-except on multiple buttons.
Also had to make wait function that waits until enter button is clickable.

# How to use
1. Right now you can only use Firefox, but you can change it easily yourself if you know how.
2. For it to work you need 'selenium' and 'geckodriver' or other driver for you browser.
3. To start it you just enter the code for the game and a name and it should work right away.
